# GRAS: A Hybrid Feature Selection Approach for Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the source code and experiment setup for the paper:

**"An Enhanced Feature Selection Technique for Churn Prediction using Hybrid Gravitational Search Algorithm and Simulated Annealing"**

## ðŸ§  Overview

The proposed GRAS method combines the global search capability of the **Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)** with the local refinement ability of **Simulated Annealing (SA)** to perform effective feature selection in customer churn prediction.

We evaluate the GRAS approach across four benchmark churn datasets and compare its performance against traditional, hybrid, and ensemble-based models.
